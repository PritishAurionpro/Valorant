Evil Geniuses have taken down EDward Gaming in three maps to advance in the playoffs stage of Champions 2023. EG will move on to face DRX in the upper bracket semifinals, while EDG will play Bilibili Gaming in the lower bracket.

The opening map was intense, as EG made a comeback from down 8-1 to force overtime before falling in the first two extra rounds. Evil Geniuses proved their prowess over the next two maps, allowing just 10 total rounds to the Chinese squad.
 “My opinions haven't changed,” Boostio said post-match. “They are the best Chinese team, but I was pretty disappointed with them and ZmjjKK.”

Demon1's 67 kills plus 55 more kills from Ethan spearheaded the firepower from Evil Geniuses. Smoggy was the only player from EDG to not go negative across the series. ZmjjKK struggled on the entry, with a -11 differential in first duels.

The first map of Split saw a sharp turn for Evil Geniuses' agent composition, putting Boostio on Chamber and Demon1 on Astra, the latter's first time ever playing the controller for EG.

The map started off disastrously for EG, losing the first seven rounds in convincing fashion, and accumulating just nine total kills in the process. The North American squad would wake up off the back of a few impressive individual displays to salvage the half at 8-4.
