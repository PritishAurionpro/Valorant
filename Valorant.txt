Evil Geniuses have taken down EDward Gaming in three maps to advance in the playoffs stage of Champions 2023. EG will move on to face DRX in the upper bracket semifinals, while EDG will play Bilibili Gaming in the lower bracket.

The opening map was intense, as EG made a comeback from down 8-1 to force overtime before falling in the first two extra rounds. Evil Geniuses proved their prowess over the next two maps, allowing just 10 total rounds to the Chinese squad.

Both teams had put forth a bit of trash talk coming into the event, most notably Boostio announcing that “China will never be better than NA.”

EDG's Chinese counterpart Billibilli Gaming had already disputed the Evil Geniuses' IGL's statement, beating North American titan NRG in not just one, but two matches to qualify for playoffs.
